# Hello-world
My foray into git and julia

Greetings,

I am a novice in systematics coding. While i can code mathematical models, I have a tough time making my code readable and adaptable.
I hope to learn and get better. My interests are Signal Processing and Control theory and I'm trying to increase my proficiency in Julia programming.
